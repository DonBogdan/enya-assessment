# Home assessment
**You are tasked with designing an automated CI/CD pipeline that deploys a container workload to a cluster. This pipeline should include a database migration step and deploy based on a branch naming convention.**

### Requirements:
- Branch Naming Convention: Propose a branch naming convention (e.g., feature/*, release/*, hotfix/*, main or master) and explain how deployments will be triggered for each branch type.
- Pipeline Tooling: Describe the CI/CD tools you would use for this pipeline and provide a rationale for your choices.
Containerization: Explain how you would containerize the application using Docker.
- Deployment: Describe the process for deploying the containerized application to a cluster.
- Database Migration: Describe the steps for incorporating a database migration into the pipeline. Mention any specific tools you would use for this task.
- Architecture Diagram: Provide a detailed diagram that outlines the architecture of the entire pipeline, including components, steps, and interactions between various tools and systems.
- Documentation: Create a document that explains the steps for setting up the pipeline and running it, as well as any assumptions or decisions you made in your design.
- Optional Video Presentation: Create an optional video presentation where you walk through your architecture and explain your design decisions. This can be a screen recording with narration.

### Deliverables:
- Architecture Diagram: A visual representation of your pipeline's architecture, including components, steps, and interactions.
- Documentation: A document detailing your design decisions, the steps to set up and run the pipeline, and any assumptions you made during the assessment.
- Optional Video Presentation: A video explainer (optional) where you walk through your architecture and explain your design decisions.

### Evaluation Criteria:
- Pipeline Design: Logical flow of the pipeline, and appropriate use of CI/CD tools.
- Containerization and Deployment: Comprehensive description of the containerization and deployment process.
- Database Migration: Clear explanation of the database migration step and rationale for your choices.
- Architecture Diagram: Quality of the architecture diagram, including clarity and comprehensiveness.
- Documentation: Clarity and comprehensiveness of the documentation.
- Best Practices: Following DevOps and design best practices.

**Time Limit: You have 72 hours from the time you receive this assessment to submit your deliverables.**

> Please note that we are interested in your thought process, problem-solving abilities, and design principles you follow, rather than the actual working of the pipeline.

Good luck!
